title: Will the Climate Crisis bring us beyond Capitalism?
---

*"The Climate Crisis is Capitalism's Waterloo"* (Yanis Varoufakis)

"Black Swan" is a label for highly upredictable events with extreme impacts.
The concept was made popular by Nassim Nicholas Taleb with his 2007 book of
the same title. Some will say the Financial Crisis in 2008 was a black swan.
As Queen Elizabeth famously asked the community of Britsish Economists:
"Why did nobody see this coming?" - Although *some* saw it coming, but not among
the mainstream scholars. Taleb - a former options trader - has later build a
whole theory around the 'Black Swan' - in his five volume Opus Magnus, 'Incerto'.

Now BIS - the Central Bank's 'Central Bank' (Bank of International Settlements in Basel)
has introduced "The Green Swan" another name for the Climate Crisis as it dawns upon
the community of Central Bankers.

The alarm bells has finally started ringing in the 'Core of Capitalism'.
2019 was the year not only Central Bankers got concerned - even Wall Street is worrying.

The OECD is trying to coordinate the worrying, talking about 'A New Economic Approach'
'Beyond Growth'.

Only Yanis Varoufakis uses the term 'Capitalism' - and speaks as if another
really might emerge.
Others stay away from naming 'The System' - and are more concerned about its 'stability' -
focusing on 'resilience' - i.e. how to make Capitalism survive the Climate Crisis.
