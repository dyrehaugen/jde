title: The Times They Are A Changing

End of an era? Donald Trump has been on his first international trip as
President of the U.S. European leaders for the first time in postwar history
finds they can no longer trust the U.S. Government. Neither in defence (Nato),
climate change (Paris Accord) or trade (TTIP). We are experiencing the slow
collapse of the hegemonic US era. Gone are the days of the Washington Concensus
and the Neoliberal economic doctrine. The EU establishment seems though to
still cling to these - Merkel & Macron want to pick up the flag abandonned
by the US and to take on a European leadership of prolonged globalisation.
Alas, watershed periods starts with confusion and nostalgia.
Forwards-looking policies are still waiting to emerge.
